Examples of coding projects I have built or worked on.  There is a good chance that any number of these projects require additional database setup to build/run a working version of the program on your local machine.  Regardless of whether the applications runs on your machine or not, you will find examples here of code I have written and procedures and practices I have followed.  I tend to code back-to-front, utilizing Unit and Implementation Testing, and following N-Tier architechtural design practices.
